This project contains an application for Mac OS X which enables inspection of classes in the Objective-C runtime.

On launch the application presents a window with a master-detail interface: the known class hierarchy appears in an outline view on the left, and details of the selected class appear on the right. Presented details include the names and types of the instance variables as well as the method signatures for instance and class methods. The window's toolbar contains a search field which enables filtering of the presented class hierarchy.

The application is written in Objective-C.
